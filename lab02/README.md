# Red Teaming GenAI Applications

This repository provides notebooks focused on red teaming for generative AI systems. The content is organized into three main sections:

1. **Overview** – Provides an introduction to red teaming in the context of Generative AI, outlining basic concepts and objectives.  
   - View details in [1.RedTeaming-Overview.ipynb](1.RedTeaming-Overview.ipynb)

2. **Planning** – Outlines a structured approach to planning red teaming exercises, including assembling a multidisciplinary team, designing tests, and reporting results.  
   - View the planning steps in [2.RedTeaming-Planning.ipynb](2.RedTeaming-Planning.ipynb)

3. **Automation** – Demonstrates automated techniques & tools for red teaming, including prompt sending, orchestrators, and risk assessment using tools like PyRIT.  
   - Explore automation methods in [3.RedTeaming-Automation.ipynb](3.RedTeaming-Automation.ipynb)

## Contents

- **Red Teaming Overview**  
  An introductory session that explains the core concepts behind red teaming to identify vulnerabilities in generative AI systems.
  
- **AI Red Teaming Planning**  
  Develop a plan for conducting red teaming exercises. This covers:
  - Defining the goals and scope of testing.
  - Assembling the team.
  - Designing and performing adversarial tests.
  - Reporting findings
  - Recommendations for continuous monitoring.
  
- **Automated Tools for Red Teaming**  
  Highlights the benefits and limitations of using automation in red teaming, including:
  - The use of orchestration tools for prompt sending.
  - Demonstrations with PyRIT for risk identification.
  - Practical examples with a medical terminology AI assistant.

## How to Use
