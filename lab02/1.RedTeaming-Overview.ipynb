    "#### What is GenAI & Why is Red Teaming Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI (GenAI), refers to AI systems capable of producing text, images, music, and other content based on input data. These systems, like GPT-4, leverage deep learning models to generate human-like outputs. Its ability to generate realistic data, code, and text help to increase our productivity and accelerates innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "GenAI applications can lead to responsible AI harms, such as generating harmful or biased content, and the potential to spread misinformation. They also pose security risks, including metadata leakage, exposure of intellectual property (IP), and user private data. These issues can negatively impact individuals and society while making the overall system vulnerable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Red Teaming**\n",
    "\n",
    "Red teaming is a strategy in which a group, known as the \"red team\", adopts the role of an adversary to challenge and test the security, effectiveness, and robustness of an organization, system, or process. This technique is commonly used in cybersecurity to identify vulnerabilities, uncover potential threats, and improve defensive strategies. The red team simulates real-world attacks, providing invaluable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the targeted system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Red teaming now involves the systematic evaluation of both security vulnerabilities and RAI harm in AI systems, especially large language models (LLMs), to identify potential harms and understand system limitations. It requires testing both **base LLMs** and **AI-enabled applications**, to identify issues and develop mitigation strategies for safer systems. Effective AI red teaming involves multiple testing iterations and continuous monitoring due to the constantly evolving nature of AI systems and attack vectors. This process improves safety and security of AI systems by addressing potential issues from malicious and benign interactions to ensure that AI models align with organizational values for safe decision-making. \n"

    "According to OWASP, key risk categories are:\n",
    "- **Security, Privacy, and Robustness Risk:** GenAI applications face threats like prompt injection, data leakage, privacy violations, and data poisoning due to malicious inputs and compromised training data.\n",
    "- **Toxicity, Harmful Content, and Interaction Risk:** These include harmful outputs like hate, abuse, profanity, biased responses, and toxic conversations, affecting user safety and trust.\n",
    "- **Bias, Content Integrity, and Misinformation Risk:** GenAI applications must address challenges related to factual accuracy, relevance, groundedness, and issues such as generating false or misleading information.\n",

    "This notebook provided an introduction to red teaming within the context of Responsible AI, particularly focusing on GenAI applications. It outlines key risks and vulnerabilities inherent to generative AI systems, such as biased outputs, leakage of sensitive information, and the generation of misleading data. It then demonstrates how to simulate adversarial scenarios—including prompt injection, system manipulation, and role-playing attacks—using a chatbot.\n",

    "- Red teaming is an essential strategy to uncover security and RAI harms in GenAI applications,\n",
    "- Repeated and varied testing are required to reveal potential vulnerabilities in LLMs due to their probabilistic nature, and \n",
    "- Proactive red teaming allows for the improvement of the overal safety, robustness, and ethical deployment of AI systems.\n",
