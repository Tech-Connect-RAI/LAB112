    "\n",
    "Automated tools for red teaming Gen AI systems are designed to systematically probe and challenge the robustness, fairness, and security of AI models. These tools help simulate a wide range of adversarial scenariosâ€”from prompt injections and biased outputs to system prompt disclosure and sensitive data leakage. By automating the testing process, teams can efficiently identify vulnerabilities, ensure consistent assessments, and continuously monitor improvements after each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- Identify and discuss the benefits and limitations of automated red teaming.\n",
    "- Explore the applications of automated red teaming in generative AI.\n",
    "- Learn how PyRIT and prompt orchestrators enable systematic adversarial testing.\n",
    "- Gain familiarity with key orchestration techniques, including prompt sending, red teaming, and the crescendo approach.\n",
    "- Analyze model responses using scoring strategies to assess security vulnerabilities and harmful output generation.\n"

    "#### Pros and Cons of Using Automated Tools for Red Teaming Gen AI Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of Automation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency & Speed:** Automated tools quickly simulate various adversarial scenarios, enabling frequent red team exercises for continuous improvement.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** Automation tests multiple models and datasets simultaneously, ideal for large-scale Gen AI systems.\n",
    "- **Consistency & Repeatability:** Ensures consistent, error-free tests for reproducible assessments.\n",
    "- **Detection of Subtle Vulnerabilities:** Systematically probes for overlooked variations, uncovering edge cases like prompt injections and biases.\n",
    "- **Resource Optimization:** Frees experts to analyze results, tune models, and develop countermeasures, instead of performing repetitive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations of Automation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Over-Reliance on Automation:** Automated tools might miss the complexity of human adversaries, overlooking important nuances.\n",
    "- **False Sense of Security:** Passing automated tests doesn't guarantee complete security; expert manual review is still necessary.\n",
    "- **Bias in Testing Framework:** Automated tools may have biases or limitations, potentially missing unexpected vulnerabilities.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored automated methodologies for red teaming generative AI systems. We reviewed the use of PyRIT as a framework for adversarial prompt generation, learned about orchestrators that simulate multi-turn interactions, and examined how gradual prompting (via the Crescendo Orchestrator) can reveal model vulnerabilities. This content equips practitioners to design experiments, understand automated evaluation metrics, and refine AI models based on the insights gathered through structured red teaming exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways**:\n",
    "- Efficiency through Automation: Automated frameworks like PyRIT reduce manual red teaming efforts by generating adversarial prompts and simulating interactions.\n",
    "- Comprehensive Testing: Different orchestrators target various vulnerabilities, from initial prompt tests to iterative adversarial interactions.\n",
    "- Incremental Vulnerability Detection: The Crescendo Orchestrator uses gradually complex prompts to reveal harmful behaviors, highlighting the need for step-by-step testing.\n",
